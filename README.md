# fed_test
The Goal
The 3 boxes have different heights because of the size of the text in them. The data comes from the CMS. This means that the content people can put in long titles or descriptions. They do this because they are insensitive to the needs of the FED. They also like uploading images of different resolutions. 

You need to use css and or javascript to make sure the boxes remain the same height at all times in order to keep the design uniform across the site. 

You are allowed to have the text mask some of the image as long as the text remains readable. 
You are allowed to have the main div mask some of the image if applicable. 
You are allowed to use javascript.

You are not allowed to set all the boxes' height to the max of the longest one. This causes too much whitespace at the bottom of a short one next to a long one.

The final product must be mobile friendly.
