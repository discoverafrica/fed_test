# Discover Africa Group - Front End Developer Test
##The Problem
There are 3 boxes (divâ€™s, cards) next to each other. They are different heights because of the content inside of them. This includes an image, heading and description. For design purposes we want to keep them all at a fixed height.

##The Goal
The 3 boxes have different heights because of the size of the text in them. The data comes from the CMS. This means that the content people can put in long titles or descriptions. They do this because they are insensitive to the needs of the FED. They also like uploading images of different resolutions. 

##The Rules
You need to use css and or javascript to make sure the boxes remain the same height at all times in order to keep the design uniform across the site. 

- You are allowed to have the text mask some of the image as long as the text remains readable. 
- You are allowed to have the main div mask some of the image if applicable. 
- You are allowed to use javascript.

- You are to keep the image container height the same regardless of the image dimensions. The image container height size and how it is determined or worked out is up for you to decide.

The final product must be mobile friendly.
